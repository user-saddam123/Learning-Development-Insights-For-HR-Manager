### 3. Distribute Trainer Performance and Trainer Topic by Training hrs.

For the request to distribute Trainer Performance and Trainer Topic by Training hours, I have created two separate bar charts. These charts provide a clear visualization of the distribution of training hours among trainers and training topics:

**1. Trainer Performance by Training Hours:**

This bar chart displays each trainer along the horizontal axis and the corresponding total training hours they have conducted along the vertical axis. HR managers can easily identify which trainers have contributed the most towards training efforts based on the length of their bars.

**2. Trainer Topic by Training Hours:**

In this bar chart, each training topic is represented along the horizontal axis, with the total training hours for each topic depicted along the vertical axis. This visualization allows HR managers to understand the distribution of training efforts across different topics, identifying which topics have received the most focus in terms of training hours.
